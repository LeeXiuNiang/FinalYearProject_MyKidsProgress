# MyKidsProgress
Nowadays, most systems turn digitally using modern technology and ease the users instead of complicated and manual methods working with hard copies.  Early childhood education is vital concerning human development. However,  many kindergartens still have areas for improvement in their system. MyKidsProgress is a mobile application developed to track the educational progress of kindergarten kids due to the inexistence of a systematic formal tracking medium for kindergartens. Besides that, the informal method used to store data will lead to messed up and loss of records easily. MyKidsProgress was developed using Flutter and Android Studio guided by Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology with the languages Dart, PHP, and MySQL. The relevant data will be stored or managed in the database server, cPanel. MyKidsProgress allowed the staff of kindergartens to manage the data regarding the staff, students, and class progress.  For staff, the roles are principal and teachers. The principal played a similar role as the super admin who is responsible to manage the teachers by adding teachers to the database while registering their accounts to the system. On other hand, the teachers can manage students' details and update their study progress which is organized into three sections which are syllabus, tasks, and tests. Through the user interface of the mobile applications, the progress details can be viewed by parents and teachers on the screen of MyKidsProgress. MyKidsProgress could ease the tasks of kindergarten staff and parents to track the study progress of kids and assist in the digitalization of data.
